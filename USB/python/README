This file will hopefully guide you on using the mcc-libusb package
that will interface to the Measurement Computing data acquisition
devices.  This package uses libusb-1.0 (not libusb-0.1 which is not
backward compatible).  This is a complete rewrite in python of the C
drivers found in ../USB/mcc-libusb. It also uses the python hidapi
package.

Go to https://github.com/trezor/cython-hidapi and install the python wrapper for the hidapi.
The instructions on how to install it.  Just run the test-usb*.py file in Python 3.

Note: The following devices are API equivalent: usb-1024LS, usb-1024HLS, usb-DIO24, usb-DIO24H

Good luck
